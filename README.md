# Project-List

In every project you have to build a TUI (Text based user interface) 
(No GUI and backend is to be used)

SECTION: K22BH

## Project 1:
Design a project where as an input student will give a static number (between 1 to 6) and then 
roll the dice which randomly generate some value between 1 to 6. The winning situation arrives 
when the given static/fixed number exactly same to the number came after rolling the dice.
User can play the game as many numbers of times he wants until user wants to exit, and 
whenever winning situation occur some scores must be given to the user, and these scores goes 
on adding if user play this game multiple number of times.
Note: Dice contains face value’s (1 to 6)
Hint: Make use of random.randint() function

## Project 2: 
Create the Rock, Paper and Scissors game with Python, we need to take the user’s choice and 
then we need to compare it with the computer choice which is taken using the random module 
in Python from a list of choices, and if the user wins, then the score will increase by 1.
Example:
User: Rock, Paper or Scissors?
CPU: rock
Tie
User: Rock, Paper or Scissors?
CPU: paper
You win! Paper covers Rock
User: Rock, Paper or Scissors?
CPU: scissors
You lose… Rock smashes Scissors
Rock, Paper or Scissors?
End the game
Final Scores:
CPU:1
User:1
Hint: Make use of random module to design the game

## Project 3: 
Email Slicer is just a simple tool that will take multiple email address as an input and slice it to 
produce the username and the domain associated with it. The email must be divided into two 
strings by using ‘@’ as the separator.
So, user provides n number of email addresses and you have to design a logic to slice the 
username and the domain out of those email addresses. The domain part must print in capitals.
Note: Email addresses must be stored first in some container and then operate the required logic 
on it.
Example:
abc@gmail.com
xyz@yahoo.com
after slicing
username :abc and domain: GMAIL.COM
username: xyz and domain: YAHOO.COM

## Project 4
Create a program that takes the length of the password as input and generates a random 
password of the same length. The strength of the password depends equally on the 4 properties 
mentioned below. If the password generated randomly following the rules or constraints given 
below, then that password is treated as good in terms of strength and accepted otherwise ignore 
that password.
The properties to be followed for a strong password are:
• At least 12 characters.
• A mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters.
• A mixture of letters and numbers.
• Inclusion of at least one special character, e.g., @ #?]
Note: do not use < or > in your password, as both can cause problems in Web browsers.

***
## Project 5:
The task is to create a script that generates a random number between a fixed range, and if the 
user guesses the number right in three chances, then user wins otherwise user lose.
This game user can play as many numbers of times and whenever user wins a score is to be given 
to the user.
At the end the users score must be displayed on the screen.
Hint: Make use of random module to design the game
Abstract steps:
• The user enters the lower and upper bounds of the range.
• As a result, the compiler generates a random integer between the range and stores it in 
a variable for future use.
• A while loop will be created for repetitive guessing.
• When a user guesses a number that is greater than a randomly selected number, the 
user receives the message “have one more try”. Your guess was too high.
• If the user guesses a number smaller than a randomly selected number, the user gets an 
output of “have one more try “. Your guess was too small”
• In addition, if the user guesses within a minimum number of attempts, they get a 
“Congrat’s” message and also get the winning scores.
• If the user fails to guess the integer in the minimum number of guesses, he/she will 
receive a “Better Luck Next Time!

## Project 6:
You need to write a python script that generates an acronym word from a given sentence.
• Take multiple strings as input in the form of list.
• Add the first letter of each string to output.
• Iterate over the complete string and add every next letter to space to output.
• Change the output to uppercase (required acronym).
• You have to generate acronyms for all given strings.
(Student is free to decide the input and output layout for this mini project)
Hint: You can use split and indexing to fetch the first word and then combine it.
***
## Project 7: 
The task is to generate a random story every time user runs the program.
Every time the user runs the program, we must produce a random tale. We'll first store the 
portions of the tales in distinct lists, and then use the Random module to choose random 
sections of the stories from those lists:
To construct a random narrative, we first imported the random module, then built sections of 
the stories in separate lists, then randomly picked portions of the lists.
Note: You store the portion of your tale/story in different lists, and during displaying the story 
when you pick the portions randomly your complete story must make some sense.
(Student is free to decide the input and output layout for this mini project)
Hint: 
• Random module can be used to select random parts of the story stored in different lists.
• Sections of the story can be an adjective, a preposition, a proper noun, etc.
***
## Project 8:
Your task is to build a currency converter that will allow you to convert currencies from one unit 
to another, such as converting Indian rupee into pounds, euros, US dollar, Canadian dollar, 
Chinese yuan, Russia’s Rubal, etc. or vice versa.
In this project build a TUI (Text based user interface), where you will enter the source currency 
to be converted and conversion rate. And after conversion display the amount in the target 
currency.

## Project 9:
You have to build a dictionary (Or any other container of your choice) which contains multiple 
True/false type quiz questions.
Every participant/user will attempt 5 rounds and in each round random quiz questions will be 
displayed to the user/participant.
If the participant answers the quiz question correct, then congratulate him and add the scores.
At the end display the details and score of the participant.

## Project 11:
In this project you have to enter a range [A, B] and system will randomly pick any number from 
your given range and check the status of that given number.
The properties to be checked are:
1. Is that number is odd or even
2. Is that number is positive or negative number
3. Is that number is prime number or composite number.
After checking the status, you have to display all the properties followed by the randomly 
picked number.
For example 
Range is (1,12) and randomly picked number is 10
Then the properties followed by this number are:
10 is a positive number
10 is an even number
10 is a composite number
(Student is free to decide the input and output layout for this mini project)
***
## Project 12:
In this project user will enter single or multiple numbers and your system will predict that the 
entered number or number’s is/are valid number(s) in a Fibonacci series or not.
For example, if user inputs 2 numbers
0 and 7
0 is valid and 7 is invalid.
Because if we plot Fibonacci series 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13……, In this series 0 is their but 7 is not 
present.
Constraint: range of the single number or multiple numbers you are entering can be huge.

## Project 14:
You have to create a repository of your classmate’s name and mobile number’s. And whenever 
you want to search the mobile/contact number of some of your classmate, you can easily search 
it out from the repository you maintained.
Searching single contact is one of the functionalities, some other functionalities your app must 
cover are:
1. Your app must be capable of displaying all the contacts with your classmate names 
present in the repository.
2. Your app must be capable of extracting contact numbers of your multiple classmates 
when required.

## Project 15:
In this project you have to enter a positive integer range [A, B] and system will find out the 
status (Prime or composite) of each number available in the given range. At the end print the 
count also.
Note: Make use of efficient approach to check prime status of the number.
For example:
Range is (7,10)
Then the status of each number in the range is:
7 is prime
8 is composite or not prime
9 is composite
10 is composite
Count: 1 prime and 3 composite numbers in the range.

Design an application where user will input two dates.
1. His/her date of birth in DD/MM/YY format.
2. Current (Present day) date in DD/MM/YY format.
Your app will calculate and let the user know how many days that person survived in 
this world.
Note: Your calculation must be accurate and you have to consider leap and non-leap years 
separately.
(Student is free to decide the input and output layout for this mini project)

## Project 17:
Your task to create a functionality in which when user will input a range of two dates. Then your 
module will find and print all years in the range of given dates those are leap years separately 
and rest of the years those are non-leap separately.
For example:
Input date range in the format dd/mm/yy
(12/01/200) to (13/12/2025)
Leaps years are:
2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024, 2028, 2032, 2036, 2040, 2044, 2048.

## Project 20: 
A basket is given to you in the shape of a matrix. If the size of the matrix is N x N then the range 
of number of eggs you can put in each slot of the basket is 1 to N2 
. You task is to arrange the 
eggs in the basket such that the sum of each row, column and the diagonal of the matrix remain 
same.
Test case for your reference:
Input by the user dimension of the basket i.e., N = 3
So, number of eggs you can put at each slot are in the range of 1 to 32
(1 to 9)
Input:
6 3 6
5 5 5
4 7 4
Explanation:
 Now the value of the sum of 
 any row or column as well as diagonal is 15
Note: 2 < = N <= 100
